# ArtVangarde

### Intro

ArtVanGarde is trying to solve the problem where artists and art buyers could exchange physical art pieces at ease and with transparency using the power of blockchain.

Each individual physical art work is represented by a non-fungible ERC721 token where it stores the hashed data of unique identification of the artwork, artist and the art certificate issuance information.

The transfer of ownership of the art work contract address will be available in the blockchain to allow transparency in terms of transaction history. ArtVanGarde gives easier access and reduce the workflow and cost for how art pieces got traded.

### The problem associated with the linkage between physical artwork and their digital representation in ERC721 token

In our platform, the ERC721 token will essentially be the smart contract address associated with a piece of digital artwork when a transfer of ownership is made. That being said, the transfer of ownership executes whenever a trade of the artwork occurs. If someone wants to sell their art on our platform, they would need to submit their identification information and also the artwork authenticity information. After we check with authority and identity of the seller, the seller will send over the physical art piece to our platform where we affix a NFC code on the physical artwork which is the ERC721 token address of the trade and ship it to the buyer. So in theory, the buyer will not have got any of the ERC721 token of the artwork they purchase until the authentic physical copy of the artwork is delivered.
